# ACMS: Design and Evaluation of an AI-Enabled Cloud–Edge Architecture for Autonomous Crop Monitoring System

Plant diseases cause substantial yield losses worldwide, and tomato crops are particularly vulnerable to early blight, late blight, and leaf mold. Manual monitoring is feasible only for small farms but impractical at a large scale. To address this challenge, we propose a cloud-based crop monitoring system that integrates unmanned aerial vehicles, deep learning, and multi-platform interfaces to enable real-time tomato disease
identification and classification via Azure IoT Hub. The system uses deep neural networks trained with TensorFlow on a curated dataset and is deployed across android, web, and edge-deviceapplications. Images can be captured using drones, smartphones, or fixed cameras for diagnostic purposes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the classification accuracy above 92%, with robust performance across different environments and device platforms. The proposed system improves disease detection efficiency, reduces the need for manual inspection, and facilitates timely interventions, thus contributing to sustainable precision agriculture.
